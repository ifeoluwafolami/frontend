<!--
    The <head> tag contains metadata and information for the document.
    Tags put in the head tag include css tag, script tag and meta tag.
    Scripts are read top to bottom so info for metadata and styling should
    be put here so they can be read first.
    Script tag should be put at the bottom of the body for one reason;
    because if it is a long script, it will slow down the download speed of
    the page. It will not optimize it for max. performance but actually bug 
    it down becase there is so much info for it to read.
